## Introduction
Lately, a significant population of Nigerian students have shown strong preference towards pursuing theirmaster’s program in the United Kingdom, with the belief that the UK is a more aﬀordable and reasonable option compared to other popular study destinations such as the United States, Australia , Canada or other parts of Europe, where they can get a fully funded scholarship and probably monthly stipends. This perception persists despite evidence suggesting that the cost of tuition, living, visa requirements and currency exchange rates can make studying in the UK comparably expensive or even more costly than the alternatives, and this may lead many Nigerian students into making a big financial mistake without fully exploring other options. This issue raises concerns about;

-Misinformation
-Inadequate access to comprehensive educational guidance
-Long-term economic burden on students and their families.
With the concerns listed above , there is a pressing need to investigate the root of this perception, access its validity, and provide a clearer comparative data to support more informed decision-making regarding international education choices through data-driven insights.
