## Introduction
Lately, a significant population of Nigerian students have shown strong preference towards pursuing theirmaster’s program in the United Kingdom, with the belief that the UK is a more aﬀordable and reasonable option compared to other popular study destinations such as the United States, Australia , Canada or other parts of Europe, where they can get a fully funded scholarship and probably monthly stipends. This perception persists despite evidence suggesting that the cost of tuition, living, visa requirements and currency exchange rates can make studying in the UK comparably expensive or even more costly than the alternatives, and this may lead many Nigerian students into making a big financial mistake without fully exploring other options. This issue raises concerns about;

-Misinformation
-Inadequate access to comprehensive educational guidance
-Long-term economic burden on students and their families.
With the concerns listed above , there is a pressing need to investigate the root of this perception, access its validity, and provide a clearer comparative data to support more informed decision-making regarding international education choices through data-driven insights.

## Objective
-The main objective of this Analysis is to Guide Nigerian Students into making Cost-Eﬀective and Informed International Education Decisions.
-Also, analyze global study destinations.
-To visualize rent, tuition fee, standard of living, and Insurance fee in diﬀerent countries and cities.

## Key Insights
-It was observed that the destination with the highest choice from respondents according to the survey is the United Kingdom

-The Reason why majority of the Respondents has not pursue their master’s degree abroad despite showing interest in International Education is Financial constraints.

-According to the survey, majority of the respondents get information about International Education, but yet are not aware of other cheaper options they can explore. This establish the fact that majority are Misinformed.

-There is a positive relationship between living cost index, Rent and Insurance. Which implies that cities with cheaper rent have lower insurance and overall cost of living.

-Some countries in Europe ,such as Iceland , Finland, Norway among others offer some of the most affordable tuition fee for international students among the regions, ranking just after Africa and Asia in terms of cost-effectiveness. This affordability, accompanied by a strong likelihood of receiving a fully funded scholarship makes it attractive as a study destination.

-Compared to other European study destinations, Greece and Finland offers relatively low rental costs, which can significantly reduce the overall cost of living for International Students.

## Recommendation

-Universities and government agencies in Greek and Finland can also capitalize on affordability by promoting housing and cost comparisons in their outreach materials to attract more international students.

-Secondary and tertiary institutions should integrate international Education counseling to ensure students receive professional guidance early in their academy journey to tackle issues of peer pressure and inadequate educational guidance.
